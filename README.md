# Semantic Merge Requests

> GitLab status check that ensures your merge requests follow the Conventional Commits spec
This is the adaptation of [Semantic Pull Requests](https://github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests) to Gitlab

## How it works

ðŸ‘® Note! The default behavior of this bot is not to police all commit messages, 
but rather to ensure that every PR has **just enough semantic information** to be 
able to trigger a release when appropriate. The goal is to gather this semantic
information in a way that doesn't make life harder for project contributors, 
especially newcomers who may not know how to amend their git commit history.

By default, only the PR title OR at least one 
commit message needs to have semantic prefix. If you wish to change this 
behavior, see [configuration](#configuration) section below.

Scenario | Status | Status Check Message
-------- | ------ | -------
PR title is [semantic][conventional commit type] | ðŸ’š | `ready to be squashed`
any commit is semantic | ðŸ’š | `ready to be merged or rebased`
nothing is semantic | ðŸ’› | `add a semantic commit or PR title`


## Installation

This should be configured as a [GitLab webhook](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html) for the [merge request event](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#merge-request-events).
This webhook listens for all the merge request events but only post comments when a new merge request by a community member is created.

![webhook configuration example](https://i.imgur.com/6Ly3Uqx.png)

1. Set `URL` to the value of the cloud run service shown in GCP console.
1. Set the `Secret Token` to be the same value as
`GITLAB_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN` set in [infrastructure/cloud-run](https://gitlab.com/merge-request-bot/infrastructure/cloud-run).
1. Tick `Merge request events`.


## Configuration

By default, no configuration is necessary.

If you wish to override some 
behaviors, you can add a `semantic.yml` file to your `.github` directory with 
the following optional settings:

```yml
# Disable validation
enabled: false
```

```yml
# Validation for merge requests mark as draft
validateDraftMr: false
```

```yml
# Always validate the PR title, and ignore the commits
titleOnly: true
```

```yml
# Always check the MR Id in MR title add it if not
addMergeRequestId: true
```

```yml
# Always validate all commits, and ignore the PR title
commitsOnly: true
```

```yml
# Always validate the PR title AND all the commits
titleAndCommits: true
```

```yml
# Require at least one commit to be valid
# this is only relevant when using commitsOnly: true or titleAndCommits: true,
# which validate all commits by default
anyCommit: true
```

```yml
# You can define a list of valid scopes
scopes:
  - scope1
  - scope2
  ...
```

```yml
# By default types specified in commitizen/conventional-commit-types is used.
# See: https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/v3.0.0/index.json
# You can override the valid types
types:
  - feat
  - fix
  - docs
  - style
  - refactor
  - perf
  - test
  - build
  - ci
  - chore
  - revert
```

```yml
# Allow use of Merge commits (eg on github: "Merge branch 'master' into feature/ride-unicorns")
# this is only relevant when using commitsOnly: true (or titleAndCommits: true)
allowMergeCommits: true
```

```yml
# Allow use of Revert commits (eg on github: "Revert "feat: ride unicorns"")
# this is only relevant when using commitsOnly: true (or titleAndCommits: true)
allowRevertCommits: true
```
